![Banana jack (4mm, 19mm) to USB-A Adapter](images/banana_to_usb_angled.png?raw=true "Banana (4mm) to USB-A")

These adpaters let you plug common power types into a bench power supply. They require a little bit of caution on your side. For example, don't apply 9 volts to the USB adapter!

Each adapter is two pieces made from a single PCB. The part that holds the banana plugs inserts into the adapter part. Then you solder them together. 


## To use them.
* One pack of [Ponoma 72918 4mm banana plug](https://octopart.com/72918-pomona+electronics-585505?r=sp). 
* Break off the two M3 holes
* Use the tabs to solder them together at 90 degrees
* Optional, add LED with current limiting resistor. 
* Optional, clamping diode.
* Plug into power supply. :)
